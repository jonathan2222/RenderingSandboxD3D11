# Sandbox Project for DirectX11

This is a sandbox project for me to learn about rendering techniques and DirectX11.

## Compilation
This uses premake5 to build the project and is already included. To build, run "Premake vs2019.bat" and it will generate the code for Visual Studio 2019. Do not forget to update the externals by running "UpdateExternals.bat" before building or build again after running it.
